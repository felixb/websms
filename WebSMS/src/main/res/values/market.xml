    <string formatted="false" name="market_about">WebSMS lets you send free and very cheap TXT/SMS via different webservices.\n\nYou will need at least one WebSMS Connector (plugin/extension) from the market to connect this app to the webservice of your choice.\nPricing depends on the webservice provider connected with the connector.\nThe "SMS" Connector shipped with the app itself sends messages via standard GSM method and is billed by your operator. It is installed for backup reasons and deactivated by default.</string>
    <string formatted="false" name="market_oss">This app is open source software build in spare time. Adding bad comments in market won\'t help much to make it better.\nPlease add your issues with this app on the app\'s website.</string>
    <string formatted="false" name="market_smsdroid">As WebSMS is not able to read messages you might find SMSdroid useful.\nSMSdroid is an alternativ message reader for people who are sending messages with any other messaging app like WebSMS.</string>
    <string formatted="false" name="market_translation">Feel free to help translating this app to your language here: https://crowdin.com/project/websms/invite</string>
